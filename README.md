# EMT
Entropy-Maxing Transformations

This project is a demonstration for entropy-maxing transforms.

Introduction to source code:
1) emtfunction.py: to implement four types of typical EMT functions. 
2) emtentropy.py: to calculate Shannon entropy and min-entropy for various distributions, 
            either after performing EMT or not. 
3) emtrate.py: to evaluate the secret outage probability (SOP) vs EMT window size
4) emtprobability: to calculate allowed key exposure probability, given secret outage probability (SOP) to be expected.
